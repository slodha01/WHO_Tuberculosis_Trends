# Features and Findings
We investigate burdens, expenditures, budgets, treatment outcomes, and community engagement. The most prominent feature in our analysis is the estimated incidence of TB per 100k people, which we used to compare to other features as a way to determine how useful that feature is in reducing incidence rate. We found that number of basic management units were negatively correlated with both incidence rate and mortality rate.
